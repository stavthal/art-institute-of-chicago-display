Hello and welcome to my github repo!

In order to use this page all you have to do is clone the repository and type in the command line:

**npm install -g nodemon** ----> This will install nodemon globally in your system, which is used to run the application and restart it automatically when changes are made.
Otherwise you can use **node server.js** everytime you make a change to the files and the server.

**npm install** ----> This will install all the dependencies for the project to run

**npm start** ----> This will start running the web application(assuming that you have installed nodemon)


Then head over to http://localhost:3000 (your default hosting route accessible only by your network) and you can start enjoying the application!
